            Overview
        </h5>
        <p lang="EN-GB">
            Our Services may include text, data, graphics, images, or other content (collectively, “Content”) created by us or third parties, including health
            care providers and partners as physicians, hospitals, polyclinics, laboratories, scan centers and pharmacies.

            1.1 Public Services
        </h5>
        <p lang="EN-GB">
            We make some Services available without registering or obtaining a password. We call these “Public Services.” You may make personal, non-commercial
            use of the Public Services so long as you comply with these Terms.
            <br>
            These services include: Directories for: Physicians, medical consultants, lab branches and scan centers’ branches.
            <br>
            Our Services include listings and directories (“Directories”) to help you find physicians, healthcare providers, lab branches and scan centers’
            branches (collectively, “Providers”). The Directories are provided for your convenience. The Directories are not comprehensive, but rather generally represent
            Providers who use our Services and who have chosen to participate in the Directories. Further, Bakiza w Za8lol does not interfere in evaluating any Provider,
            only patients and consumers who have log in rights do the evaluation based on their opinion and the listing of a Provider does not in any way constitute a
            recommendation of such Provider. Before obtaining services or treatment from any Provider listed in a Directory, you should take the same care you would
            under any other circumstance, including by confirming licensure and specialty certifications. The Providers are solely responsible for the
            appropriateness and quality of the services they provide. Additionally, the Directories rely on information submitted by Providers themselves. Unless Providers
            provide us with current information, the Directory information may not be timely or accurate. You should confirm such information before obtaining services or
            treatment from a Provider. As a convenience, the Services may permit you to request an appointment with a Provider. However, Providers are responsible for
            maintaining their own schedules, and we cannot ensure that any given Provider will be available, or that such Provider will not cancel his or her appointment.
